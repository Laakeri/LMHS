LMHS MaxSAT Solver

LMHS uses a hybrid SAT-IP approach to solve MaxSAT problem instances in WCNF format.
Benchmark instances can be downloaded from the MaxSAT Evaluation websites http://www.maxsat.udl.cat/
LMHS uses MiniSat as its underlying IP solver and MaxPre as its preprocessor.

An IP solver must be separately installed to use LMHS. 
Currently only IBM CPLEX is supported without modification to the source code. 
A free academic license for CPLEX can be obtained through the IBM Academic Initiative.
LMHS has been tested with CPLEX 12.7

Run the configure.py script before compiling LMHS to set the necessary IP solver filepaths.

To compile LMHS, run 'make' in this directory. 

To compile release version:
make clean && make release

To compile debug version:
make clean && make debug 

To invoke the solver, run
./bin/LMHS <wcnf filepath> <params>

By default, LMHS uses its 2017 MaxSAT evaluation configuration.

For information on solver parameters, run LMHS with the --help flag.
