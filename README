LMHS MaxSAT Solver

LMHS uses a hybrid SAT-IP approach to solve MaxSAT problem instances in WCNF format.
Benchmark instances can be downloaded from the MaxSAT Evaluation websites http://www.maxsat.udl.cat/
Two choices of SAT solver, MiniSAT and Lingeling, are included and ready to use.

An IP solver must be separately installed to use LMHS. 
Two IP solvers, IBM CPLEX and SCIP, are supported without modification to the source code. 
A free academic license for CPLEX can be obtained through the IBM Academic Initiative.
SCIP can be downloaded at http://scip.zib.de/
LMHS has been tested with CPLEX 12.6 and SCIP 3.1.0.

Run the configure.py script before compiling LMHS to set the necessary IP solver filepaths.

To compile LMHS, run 'make' in this directory. 

make accepts the following parameters:
	SAT={minisat|lingeling}  choose SAT solver module
	MIP={cplex|scip}         choose MIP solver module
	LMHS_DEBUG={0|1}         compile with -DDEBUG, reduce optimization, include gdb debug info
	STATIC={0|1}             produce binary with statically linked libgcc, libstdc++
	CONFIG={2015I|2015C}     use a MaxSAT Evaluation 2015 configuration

To invoke the solver, run
./bin/LMHS <wcnf filepath> <params>

For information on solver parameters, run LMHS with the --help flag.
